If you need help with an application security incident, the request should come from the System Owner or Org Manager, to help us validate the request.

You should not include any passwords or sensitive environment variables in your email (we don't need them to help you, and you should keep them protected).

### Report a vulnerability

We welcome vulnerability reports [according to our vulnerability disclosure policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/), which includes how to best contact us for this kind of information.

### Questions from the public and industry

If you have a question that isn't on behalf of a U.S. government organization (such as if you're a member of the public or representing a company), we invite you to post your question [publicly as an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/cg-site/issues/new) (requires a free GitHub account), so that we can write an answer available to everyone. If you prefer not to post publicly, you can email [inquiries@cloud.gov](mailto:inquiries@cloud.gov).

If you are part of a company asking a question to help prepare a response to a RFI/RFQ/RFP (or a similar proposal process), we will ask you to post your question [publicly as an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/18F/cg-site/issues/new) (requires a free GitHub account). We want to answer publicly so that our answer is available to all companies competing in that process.
